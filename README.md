Customer churn risk, the likelihood of customers
discontinuing their relationship with a business, poses a signif-
icant challenge to companies across industries. Factors such as
customer satisfaction, market dynamics, and lack of engagement
contribute to churn risk, impacting revenue and long-term
profitability. This paper addresses the challenge of analyzing
and predicting customer churn risk, employing machine learning
techniques to classify customers into high, medium, and low
churn risk categories. Three Support Vector Machine (SVM)
models were developed, utilizing different feature reduction
methods including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Principal
Component Analysis (PCA), and Linear Discriminant Analysis
(LDA) with an optimal component selection strategy. Our experi-
mental results demonstrate that the SVM model employing LDA
outperforms others, achieving an accuracy of 93.47% and an F1
score of 0.93 on the test dataset. This research underscores the
effectiveness of machine learning in mitigating customer churn
risk, offering valuable insights for businesses to enhance customer
retention strategies and sustain long-term success in a dynamic
market environment
